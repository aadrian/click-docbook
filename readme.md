Docbook for the Apache Click Framework
======================================

This project provides a modified [Velocity Docbook Framework][1] to generate
[Apache Click][2] documentation. The following changes were made:

[1]: <http://velocity.apache.org/docbook/>

[2]: <http://click.apache.org>

-   Upgraded to Apache FOP v0.95 (this version supports soft page breaks)

-   Upgraded to Docbook XLS v1.75.0 (this version supports syntax highlighting)

-   Includes XSLTHL syntax highlighter version 2.0.1

There is no distribution available for download. Instead Apache Click will
automatically download the necessary dependencies from this project.

This project provides a modified [Velocity Docbook Framework](http://velocity.apache.org/docbook/) to generate [Apache Click](http://incubator.apache.org/click/) documentation. The following changes were made:

  * Upgraded to Apache FOP v0.95 (this version supports soft page breaks)
  * Upgraded to Docbook XLS v1.75.0 (this version supports syntax highlighting)
  * Includes XSLTHL syntax highlighter version 2.0.1

There is no distribution available for download. Instead Apache Click will automatically download the necessary dependencies from this project.
